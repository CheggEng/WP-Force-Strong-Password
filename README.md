# WP-Force-Strong-Password
Wordpress 4.3+ now encourages using strong passwords but it still gives the user a option to use a weak password if they click confirm use of a weak password.  This simple plugin takes away the option to allow weak password override.  The end result is a wordpress site that assures strong passwords are used.
